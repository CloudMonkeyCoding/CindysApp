# Agent Instructions

- When working with the Cindy's Delivery Android project, consult the upstream API implementation at <https://github.com/CloudMonkeyCoding/Cindys-Bakeshop/tree/main/PHP> for reference when adjusting network calls.
- The production server for these APIs is hosted at `https://evotech.slarenasitsolutions.com/`.
- Continue to use `rg` for repository-wide searches instead of `grep -R` or `ls -R`.
